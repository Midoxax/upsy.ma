const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "What causes brain fog?",
    a: "The most common drivers are sleep debt, chronic stress load, blood-sugar instability, dehydration, and cognitive overload from context-switching. Medical causes to rule out include thyroid dysfunction, iron and B12 deficiency, sleep apnea, and post-viral syndromes. Most non-medical brain fog resolves within 3–4 weeks of consistent sleep, hydration, and single-tasking.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get rid of brain fog fast?",
    a: "In 48 hours you can move the needle: 7+ hours of sleep two nights running, 2–3 litres of water daily, protein at breakfast, one deep-work block instead of constant switching, and a 20-minute walk outdoors. If nothing shifts in a week, the cause is likely medical or clinical — get bloodwork done.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is brain fog a sign of something serious?",
    a: "Usually no. Occasionally yes. Persistent fog lasting more than a month, especially with weight change, cold intolerance, hair changes, unexplained fatigue, or new depressive symptoms, warrants a GP visit. Ask specifically for thyroid panel (TSH, T3, T4), ferritin, B12, vitamin D, and fasting glucose.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can stress cause brain fog?",
    a: "Yes. Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which impairs prefrontal cortex function — the brain region responsible for focus, planning, and working memory. Stress-driven fog typically comes with poor sleep and rumination. The fix is nervous-system regulation, not more coffee.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does brain fog mean I have depression or ADHD?",
    a: "Not necessarily, but both commonly present with brain fog. If low mood, loss of interest, or lifelong distractibility accompany the fog, a proper assessment is worth it. Both conditions are highly treatable and improve cognitive clarity within weeks of the right support.",

                  Brain fog is not laziness and it is not "just stress". It is a signal — usually
                  from sleep, blood sugar, nervous-system load, or something medical worth checking.
                  Here is how to read the signal and act on it.

                <p className="text-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Brain fog is a subjective loss of mental clarity — slow processing, weak working
                  memory, difficulty finding words, and a sense that thinking takes effort. It is a
                  symptom, not a diagnosis. The job is to find the driver and remove it.

                  Fog persisting past four weeks despite good sleep and hydration deserves a full
                  workup. Ask specifically for thyroid panel (TSH, T3, T4), ferritin, B12, vitamin
                  D, fasting glucose, and HbA1c. Rule out sleep apnea if you snore or wake unrested.
                  Rule out anxiety and depression with a psychologist — both routinely present as
                  fog before mood.
