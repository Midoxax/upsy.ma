const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "How can I improve my focus quickly?",
    a: "In 24 hours you cannot rewire attention, but you can remove the two biggest leaks: phone in another room during one 60–90 minute block, and 7+ hours of sleep the night before. Together these two changes recover more focus than any supplement or app on the market.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do I lose focus after 20 minutes?",
    a: "Sustained attention is a limited resource that depletes with every context-switch, notification, and micro-decision. Most people are not losing focus at 20 minutes — they are being pulled out of it by an interruption. Protect the block with airplane mode and a single-tab browser and the 20 minutes typically stretches to 60–90.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do high performers train focus?",
    a: "Elite operators treat focus as a trainable skill: one protected deep-work block per day at the same time, a fixed start ritual (same drink, same seat, same music), single-tasking discipline, and hard recovery blocks. Consistency beats intensity — 60 minutes daily outperforms an occasional 4-hour marathon.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is ADHD the reason I can't focus?",
    a: "Only a licensed clinician can diagnose ADHD. That said, most focus complaints in adults resolve with sleep, single-tasking, and phone hygiene. If those changes don't help after 4–6 weeks of honest effort, a proper assessment is worth doing — untreated ADHD is common and highly treatable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do focus apps and supplements work?",
    a: "Website blockers help by removing the friction of self-control. Nootropic supplements have weak evidence — caffeine is the only one with robust support and it comes with a sleep cost. The highest-leverage 'stack' remains sleep, hydration, protein at breakfast, one deep-work block, and a phone in another room.",

                  Focus is not a personality trait. It is a trainable skill — and the levers that
                  move it most are surprisingly few. Here is the evidence-based playbook.

                  Focus is the trained capacity to <em>hold</em> attention on one thing and{" "}
                  <em>release</em> it when you choose. Most focus problems are not attention
                  deficits — they are release deficits. The mind gets grabbed by a notification,
                  a thought, a tab, and never returns cleanly. Improving focus means reducing what
                  grabs you and training the return.

                  a session. Persistent focus problems commonly come from anxiety, low-grade
                  depression, thyroid or iron deficiency, or undiagnosed ADHD — all treatable, none
                  reachable through willpower alone.
