const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "What is mental performance?",
    a: "Mental performance is the trained capacity to think clearly, regulate emotion, and sustain focus under pressure. Unlike therapy, which resolves distress, mental performance training builds the cognitive and emotional skills that drive execution — attention control, stress tolerance, recovery, and decision-making.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I improve my mental performance?",
    a: "Improvement follows a measurable loop: (1) baseline your cognitive and emotional state with a validated assessment, (2) identify the two or three levers with the highest leverage (sleep, focus, stress recovery, or self-talk), (3) train them for 6–12 weeks with a coach or protocol, (4) re-measure. Consistency beats intensity — 20 minutes daily outperforms occasional long sessions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How to build mental toughness?",
    a: "Mental toughness is built through graded exposure to controlled discomfort plus deliberate recovery. Train four pillars: confidence (evidence-based, not affirmations), concentration (single-task blocks), control (breath and physiology regulation), and commitment (values-anchored goals). Toughness without recovery becomes burnout.",
  },
  {
    q: "What causes brain fog and mental fatigue?",
    a: "The most common drivers are sleep debt, chronic stress load, blood-sugar instability, dehydration, and cognitive overload from context-switching. Rule out medical causes (thyroid, iron, B12, sleep apnea) before behavioral work. Most cases resolve within 3–4 weeks of sleep, hydration, and single-tasking discipline.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I improve focus and productivity?",
    a: "Protect one 90-minute deep-work block per day, phone in another room. Use a fixed start cue (same time, same drink, same music). Batch shallow work into two windows. Sleep 7+ hours — every hour under 7 costs roughly one IQ point of working memory the next day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a mental performance coach or a therapist?",
    a: "A therapist treats clinical distress (anxiety, depression, trauma). A mental performance coach or psychologist trains healthy people to perform better under load — athletes, founders, executives, students, medical staff. If you feel functional but plateaued, coaching. If daily life is suffering, therapy first. U.Psy offers both and will route you correctly.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to see results?",
    a: "Focus and stress-regulation gains show within 2–4 weeks. Deeper shifts in confidence, self-talk, and identity take 8–12 weeks. Elite-level consistency is a 6–12 month arc. We re-measure every 4 weeks so progress is visible, not felt.",
