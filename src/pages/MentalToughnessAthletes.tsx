const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "How do I stop overthinking before a competition?",
    a: "Overthinking is a signal that your attention has drifted from the process to the outcome. The fix is not to think less — it is to think about the right thing. Anchor to one or two performance cues you control (breath, first movement, tempo). When the mind spirals to results, name the thought ('outcome thought'), exhale, and return to the cue. Trained daily, this cuts pre-event rumination by 40–60% within four weeks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do I get nervous or freeze in competition when I'm fine in training?",
    a: "Training loads your body; competition loads your identity. When self-worth is on the line, the nervous system tilts toward threat and pulls resources from fine motor control and decision-making. The solution combines physiology (slow exhale, 6-second out-breath) and cognition (values-based pre-performance script). This is trainable in 6–8 sessions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I build real mental toughness as an athlete?",
    a: "Mental toughness is not grit under punishment — it is the trained capacity to regulate, refocus, and re-engage under load. Four pillars: confidence built from evidence (not affirmations), concentration held on process cues, control of physiology through breath, and commitment to values that survive bad days. Toughness without recovery becomes burnout.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best pre-competition routine to calm nerves?",
    a: "A repeatable 10-minute sequence beats any single technique: 3 minutes of nasal breathing at 6 breaths/min, 3 minutes of movement rehearsal with eyes closed, 2 minutes of a self-selected cue word or trigger phrase, and 2 minutes of the first competitive action at low intensity. Same sequence every time — the ritual itself becomes a down-regulation signal.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I stop replaying mistakes during a game or match?",
    a: "Elite athletes use a 'reset window' — a defined 5- to 10-second protocol between plays: physical trigger (touch wristband, adjust cap), one deep exhale, one process cue, then re-engage. The trigger interrupts rumination physically before it entrenches. Trained in 3–4 sessions, applied for a season.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I come back mentally strong after an injury?",
    a: "Physical recovery is only half. Athletes returning from injury commonly carry re-injury fear, identity loss, and confidence gaps that show up as hesitation or over-caution. A structured 8–12 week protocol combines graded exposure to competitive cues, imagery rehearsal, self-talk restructuring, and confidence rebuilding around small measurable wins.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a sport psychologist or a mental performance coach?",
    a: "A sport psychologist is a licensed clinician who can also treat anxiety, depression, eating issues, and trauma common in athlete populations. A mental performance coach trains healthy athletes to perform better — no clinical scope. If nerves are affecting daily life beyond sport, choose the psychologist. If it is purely performance, either works. U.Psy routes you to the right specialist.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to see results?",
    a: "Pre-competition nerves and overthinking respond within 3–5 sessions. Deeper shifts in confidence and identity take 8–12 weeks. A full competitive season is the standard arc for lasting change. We re-measure every 4 weeks so progress is visible, not felt.",
